psubprocess
===========

psubprocess is a python application that makes very easy to parallelize other non-parallel software. psubprocess does the parallelization splitting the input files, launching several non-parallel application processes and merging all results. All applications that process the input items one by one in an independent way and create an output composed by several items can be parallelized by psubprocess.
